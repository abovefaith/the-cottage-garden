        <p>
          I have been teaching and caring for young children since 1968, when I began my career in New York City as a nanny while still a teenager. In 1976, when my daughter was 14 months old, I opened a Waldorf-inspired home daycare program called, The Other Mother, which I operated for 10 years. During this period, I was very involved in helping the City re-develop the process of licensing home day care providers. Ultimately, I was one of the first to receive licensing under these new rulings. I also taught courses at the 92nd Street YMHA on all aspects of developing a home day care program, from business to crafts, and appeared on a Lifetime cable television program called Working Mother, which was seen nationwide.Although I was highly successful on my own, I had a desire to work within a community of Waldorf teachers. I returned to school, received my Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education at Empire State College, and became a kindergarten teacher at the Rudolf Steiner School in New York City, where I taught for 4 years. I joined the Waldorf Early Childhood Association of North America, WECAN, in 1983. I have attended most WECAN annual conferences since that time and I have taught many workshops in subjects such as: First Grade Readiness; Watercolor Painting; and Children’s Games. Along the way, I have taught adults various subjects related to Waldorf Education, I have mentored Waldorf early childhood teachers in schools across the nation and, over the years, I have trained many interns in my classroom. I co-taught the class: Introduction to the Waldorf Kindergarten, at Sunbridge College, in Spring Valley, NY for three summers. In 199I, I moved to Amherst, MA where I taught kindergarten at The Hartsbrook (Waldorf) School in Hadley for 18 years.I also have a passionate interest in both arts and crafts. I have worked as a jeweler, as a fiber artist, and I have been studying painting for many years at the Rudolf Steiner Institute, where I was a member of the board of trustees and managed our summer bookstore.Now, in this phase of my life, I am continuing my vocation on a much smaller scale. In the spring of 2009, I opened The Cottage Garden, a Waldorf Home Nursery program, licensed for up to ten children, with my wife, Barbara Audley. We have been together since 1992, and this is our first endeavor working together. We are enjoying every minute of it!
